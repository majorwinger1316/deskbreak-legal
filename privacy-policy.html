  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 30 April, 2025</p>

  <p>At DeskBreak, we take the privacy of our users ("you", "your") very seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information through our mobile application, DeskBreak ("App", "Application", "we", "us"). By using the App, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may update it from time to time. Your continued use of the App indicates your agreement with the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Personal Information</h2>
  <p>DeskBreak may collect certain personal data such as your:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name, email address (if signing in via Google, Apple, or Email/Password)</li>
    <li>Stretch activity details (e.g., type, duration, points earned)</li>
    <li>Community participation data (username, total minutes, scores, etc.)</li>
    <li>Schedule reminders set by you</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Users may also use DeskBreak as a guest with limited features. Some information may still be stored locally on the device.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Most data is stored locally on your device. We may also use secure cloud storage to sync or back up data if you’re logged in. We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Camera, TrueDepth API & Sensor Access</h2>
  <p>DeskBreak uses the front camera, including Apple’s TrueDepth API and ARKit, solely for real-time posture and body tracking during stretching sessions. This allows us to guide your movements and provide feedback on your form.</p>

  <p><strong>No photos, videos, or depth data are ever recorded, stored, or transmitted.</strong> All camera and sensor processing happens entirely on your device in real-time. We do not collect, retain, or share any facial recognition data, depth maps, or body pose data.</p>

  <p>Camera access is only required during active stretching sessions, and you may choose to disable it in your device settings. However, certain posture guidance features may not function without it.</p>


  <h2>4. Notifications</h2>
  <p>DeskBreak uses local notifications to remind you of your scheduled stretching sessions. You can manage these notifications in your device settings.</p>

  <h2>5. Communities</h2>
  <p>When you join or create a community, your name, scores, and minutes may be visible to other members. Public communities are displayed on a map and require location access to function. If location access is denied or disabled, the app will automatically restrict you to creating or joining <strong>private communities only</strong>. Private communities require an invite code and are not listed on the public map. We do not share community data outside the app ecosystem.</p>

  <h2>6. Health & Fitness Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>DeskBreak offers guided stretches for wellness. It is not a substitute for medical advice. Please consult a physician before starting any new physical activity, especially if you have health conditions.</p>

  <h2>7. Analytics & Device Data</h2>
  <p>We may collect anonymous usage data to improve the app experience. This includes device type, OS version, and in-app behavior. This data is not linked to your identity.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use standard practices to protect data, including encrypted communication and secure storage. However, no system can guarantee complete security. You are responsible for securing your device and login credentials.</p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>DeskBreak is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under this age.</p>

  <h2>10. Policy Changes</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. We will notify users via the app in the event of major changes. Please review this page regularly.</p>
